Hi! I'm Yury Habets.

I love low-level coding, performance investigations, SIMD and solving puzzles as they appear in software. You may also notice that I tend to stick to gamedev, Android and Arm because this is what I devoted more than a decade of my life together with Unity.

My blog includes some findings that I found worth sharing - enjoy!
